# AI-Object-Outline-and-Animation
This project consists of training and then implementing two different image segmentation artificial intelligence models, in order to provide the outline of objects in images. The Fourier Coefficients of these outlines are extracted, converted to rotating vectors in the complex plane, and then animated.
